Compileï¼š

refering https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything.

install all dependences.

then use "bam server_release" and you can get the server binary file "teeworlds_srv".

use "bam -c all" to clean all compiled file if you make some change to the source and then want to compile again.
